    <h3>What is Paywall Fraud?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>You just experienced a simulated "paywall fraud" attack.</strong>
      <br>
      You paid USDC on Sepolia testnet to access premium content, but were
      redirected to this warning page instead which doesn't contain the
      content you were expecting.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is this a problem?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        This is a problem because it will discourage people from trusting x402
        micropayments or make client implemtnations only trust a limited number of
        facilitators.
      </strong>
      <br><br>
      Individual facilitators will need to implement their own fraud
      prevention solutions to protect their users or risk being complicit in
      fraud. As facilitators compete to offer the most secure solutions, the
      most effective anti-fraud facilitators will gain dominant market
      positions forming a natural centralization of the protocol. This centralization will
      allow a small number of facilitiators to capture the majority of market share to either
      capture revenue from the protcol via fees and or influence the future of the
      protocol to favor their own preferences.

    <h3>How did my browsing history end up onchain?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        all transactions are published onchain publicly by default
      </strong>
      <br><br>
      This means your wallet address and payments to a registered recipient can be tracked based
      on the recipient's wallet address and correlated to the content you were
      willing to pay for. Check out all the other people who did too on 
      <a href="https://www.x402scan.com/recipient/${process.env.WALLET_ADDRESS}/transactions">
        x402scan explorer
      </a>
    </p>

    <h3>Why is this a problem?</h3>
    <p>
      The transactions published on chain and connected to your wallet
      address can be used for advertising purposes for the content you were willing to pay for so
      advertisers can build an economic profile of you. Alternatively, if other
      scammers determine that you visited this page and were willing to pay for
      this content, they could airdrop an NFT advertisement to your wallet to
      trick you into visiting more scam sites.
