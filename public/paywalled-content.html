    <h3>What is Paywall Fraud?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>You just experienced a simulated "paywall fraud"
        attack.</strong>
      <br>
      You paid USDC on Sepolia testnet (it's not real money) to
      access premium content, and did not receive the content you were expecting.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is this a problem?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        This is a problem because it will discourage people from trusting
        x402
        micropayments or make client implementations only trust a limited
        number of
        facilitators.
      </strong>
      <br><br>
Individual facilitators will need to implement their own fraud prevention
solutions to protect users from fraud. As facilitators compete to offer the
most secure solutions, the most effective anti-fraud facilitators will gain
dominant market positions, forming a natural centralization of the x402
protocol. This centralization will grant a few facilitators the
majority of market share. Over time, these select few facilitators will be
able to determine the direction of the protocol and limit access for
others. This centralization has already started to happen with the
currently registered

      supported facilitators.

    <h3>How did my browsing history end up onchain?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        All transactions are published onchain publicly by default.
      </strong>
      <br><br>
      Your wallet address and x402 payments to registered recipients can be
      tracked. When you pay for content, your wallet address becomes linked to
      that content through public transaction data visible on blockchain
      explorers. For example, you can view all payments for this page on the
      <a
        href="https://sepolia.basescan.org/token/0x036cbd53842c5426634e7929541ec2318f3dcf7e?a=0x14fd5ea59d8f9cfdb173e25b4fc4d3dbb14692bf">
        Base Sepolia Explorer.
      </a> 
    </p>

    <h3>Why is this a problem?</h3>
    <strong>
      Each transaction reveals which wallet viewed the page, when they viewed it, and how often they visited the page.
    </strong>

    <p>
      Onchain transactions linked to a wallet address can be used to build
      economic profiles based on content the owner is willing to pay for. Now
      everyone can see that edgy site you visited, not just Google.
      Additionally, scammers can identify visitors to known scam sites as
      potential targets and airdrop advertisement NFTs to their wallet to trick them
      into visiting more scam sites.

    <h3>Contribute to the solution of Privacy by Default</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>We need to solve this problem by adding
      privacy by default to the x402 payment protocol:</strong>
